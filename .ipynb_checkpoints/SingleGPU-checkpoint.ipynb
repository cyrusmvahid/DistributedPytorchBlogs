    "In this article series we are going to take a fundamental and intuitive look at distributed training for deep learning. We look at why training deep learning models lends itself so fittingly to be distributed and we look at the does and the don’t for distributed training. We use pytorch 2.0 for coding and we look into optimizers outside of pytorch’s scope that are designed for training. Along with it all, we look into how to optimize your training for multi CPU and multi GPU environments.\n",

    "It does look very grim in the first look, but the good news is that in the computaiton of matrix multiplication we have seen all the addition and subtractions are basically independent of what another in the way that the output of none of the calculations is the entry to the next. So we can do all the multiplications individually and then do addition and then compile the results as they come.\n",
    "If we want to run this operation on large matrices on your laptop that has 64 cores, we can run 64 instructions at a time. On an NVIDIA A100 one can run up to 624 trillion floating point operations per second (TFLOPS) or up to 2496 TOPS (trillion operations per second) when it comes to INT4, which is important when you are trying to squeeze every bit compression through quantization. (take a look at page 14 of the presentation I gave at Cambrige Wireless conference in 2017 or for more detailed info look up [Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149)).  \n",

Luckily, NVIDIA created CUDA(Compute Unified Device Architecture) that allow access to GPU features without having to programme hardware. At this point I am not going into hardware architecture of CPU and GPU, so please take my word for it.\n",

    "We can see that this is a bit more sophisticated version of the previous example. Here the blue blocks are the forward pass, the grey blocks are the computational blocks of the backward pass, and orange blocks are interim savings of the computations. The job of a computattional engine of a deep learning framework is to get the model, map all the required computation, create a dependency map, and run all those that are not dependent on one another in parallel.\n",
    "Taking a deeper look in this graph, demonstrate that each layer is composed of compuration that can run in parallel, for instance, the forward pass on the second layer of the nework ($128 \\rightarrow 64$) has to wait for the forward pass of the first layer ($784 \\rightarrow 128$) to complete first, while the automated gradients of the first layer can be calculated in parallel with forward pass of the second layer. The orange block *mat1* is computed and saved two steps before it has been used by *AdmmBackward0*. \n",

    "We define the network, then pytorch uses autograpd engine to create the computatinoal graph ([more info here](https://pytorch.org/blog/computational-graphs-constructed-in-pytorch/)), we then ask pytorch to put both data and the model onto GPU, and finally run the training. all the cuda magic is taken care of behind the scene. What actually happens is that a minibatch of data is sent to GPU cores and forward path is performed, gradients are calculated and backward path is performed, then gradients are combined and the next minibatch is trained. Once we reach the enf of the data, an epoc is completed and the next epoc will start. This all is done using parallel computation using GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "*** Note: Beware that you should always monitor your GPU utilization. There are a lot of element that prevent your GPU form being fully utilized. One simple fact to remember is that preparing your minibatches are performed in CPU. The default value for the number of CPUs that are used in th DataLoader object is 1. You want to increase that to at least double the number of GPUs. Depending on your minibatch size and other factors that might not be enough so you can play with the numnber. \n",

As the last word I would like to bring the GPU utilization for training a Yolo5 model on a P3EC2 machine and you can see how spiky the GPU utilization is. This is a graph from about 10 minutes of training and reflects only working on 1 GPU from the 4 the model is trained on. Long term graph shows the same pattern on all 4 GPUs.\n",
